With your help, we're working together to make this forum .\n\n\nThe modern forum originated from bulletin boards, and so-called computer conferencing systems, and are a technological evolution of the dialup bulletin board system. From a technological standpoint, forums or boards are web applications managing user-generated content.\n\nEarly Internet forums could be described as a web version of an electronic mailing list or newsgroup (such as exist on Usenet); allowing people to post messages and comment on other messages. Later developments emulated the different newsgroups or individual lists, providing more than one forum, dedicated to a particular topic.\n\nInternet forums are prevalent in several developed countries. Japan posts the most with over two million per day on their largest forum, 2channel. China also has many millions of posts on forums such as Tianya Club.\n\n\n\nAn unregistered user of the site is commonly known as a guest or visitor. Guests are typically granted access to all functions that do not require database alterations or breach privacy. A guest can usually view the contents of the forum or use such features as read marking, but occasionally an administrator will disallow visitors to read their forum as an incentive to become a registered member. A person who is a very frequent visitor of the forum, a section or even a thread is referred to as a lurker and the habit is referred to as lurking. Registered members often will refer to themselves as lurking in a particular location, which is to say they have no intention of participating in that section but enjoy reading the contributions to it.\n\n\nThe administrators  manage the technical details required for running the site. As such, they may promote members to/from moderators, manage the rules, create sections and sub-sections, as well as perform any database operations. Administrators often also act as moderators. Administrators may also make forum-wide announcements, or change the appearance  of a forum. There are also many forums where administrators share their knowledge\n","comment":[{"commenter":"Flynn","date":"2015-08-10T06:21:10.804Z","commentData":"Hello admin,\nGlad to see this loooooooooong post about the forum...","rating":"7"},{"commenter":"Robert","date":"2015-08-10T06:21:50.508Z","commentData":"too long indeed...\nand Very boring","rating":"3"}]},{"ptitle":"How to get started with Linux: A beginner's guide","topic":"GNU/LINUX is the world's best and the most powerful OS available.","author":"Flynn","date":"2015-08-06T09:23:45.991Z","avgrating":9,"psummary":" The world of Linux is ready to welcome you, with a shower of free open-source software you can use on any PC: hundreds of active Linux distributions, and dozens of different desktop environments you could run on them. It’s a far cry from the one-size-fits-all, this-is-just-what-comes-with-your-PC.","image":"http://www.geekstogo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GNU-Linux_logo.png","pdescription":"<b>Install Linux, or not</b><br />\n\nYou have choices about when and how to install Linux. You can leave it on a disc or USB drive and boot it up whenever you want to play with it. Play with it several times until you’re sure you want to install it. You can try several Linux distributions in this way-you can even re-use the same USB drive.\n\nThe big reasons to install Linux instead of just running it from a USB drive or disc are productivity and convenience. Unlike running Linux live, installed Linux will remember your settings, keep your installed software, and maintain your files between reboots.\n\n    Want to stay up to date on Linux, BSD, Chrome OS, and the rest of the World Beyond Windows? Bookmark the World Beyond Windows column page or follow our RSS feed.\n\nOnce you’re ready to take the plunge, installing Linux on your PC is easy-just launch the installer provided in the live Linux environment. You have yet another choice here, though: You could wipe away your existing Windows system (assuming that’s your current OS) and replace it with Linux, but installing it in a “dual-boot” configuration, or “alongside Windows,” in Ubuntu installer parlance, is the more flexible choice. The installer will resize your Windows partition to make room for Linux, and you can select which operating system you want to use every time you boot your computer.\n\n\n<br /><b>How to install more software</b><br />\n\n Software installation on Linux works very differently from software installation on Windows. You don’t need to open your web browser and search for applications. Instead, look for the software installer on your system. On Ubuntu, this is the Ubuntu Software Center. On Linux Mint, it’s the Software Manager. On Fedora, it’s just named Software.\n\nThis isn’t just a fancy interface for downloading software from the web. Your Linux distribution hosts its own “software repositories,” containing software compiled to work with it. This software is tested and provided by the Linux distribution. If security patches are necessary, your Linux distribution will provide them to you in a standard way. \n\n Basically, it’s like an app store full of free, open-source software-except Linux distributions were doing “app stores” like this long before Apple popularized the concept.\n\nSome applications-particularly closed-source applications like Google Chrome, Steam, Skype, Minecraft, and others-must be installed from outside your Linux distribution’s package manager. You can download these applications from their official websites, just as you would on Windows. Be sure to download the installer package designed for the Linux distribution you’re using.\n\nContrary to widespread belief, you probably don’t need to install hardware drivers manually when you install the operating system. Most of the hardware drivers you’ll need are built-in on Linux. There are a few closed-source drivers you might want-the Nvidia and AMD drivers for optimal 3D graphics performance, or Wi-Fi drivers to make your Wi-Fi hardware work right. \n\n\n Ubuntu and Linux Mint will recommend these to you via their hardware driver tools, if necessary. Some Linux distributions may not help you install these at all. For example, Fedora doesn’t want to endorse closed-source Linux drivers.\n\nDespite the software installation differences, Linux should feel reasonably familiar for anyone who’s used a Windows desktop before. You’ll find windows, context menus, control panels, and more. Many of the applications you’ll use on Linux are popular programs you may have already used on Windows, from Firefox to VLC and LibreOffice. And now you have the basic knowledge you need to get started using Linux. Happy exploring!

Very silly. Since launching nine days ago Windows Update has sent out an unstable graphics driver which switched off monitors, a buggy security patch which corrupted Windows Explorer and there are now a number of reports that a third update is causing Window 10 machines to crash over and over again…\n\nThe patch in question is KB3081424 (ironically enough a roll-up of bug fixes) and during its update process affected users find it fails and triggers the message: “We couldn’t complete the updates, undoing the changes.” Undoing them results in a mandatory system reboot, but as soon as the user logs back on Windows 10’s update process kicks in and tries to install KB3081424 again.\n\nI’m sure you’re way ahead of me here, but since Windows 10 updates cannot be stopped KB3081424 tries to install over and over again which leaves systems caught in endless reboot loops.\n\n\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Why wouldn’t KB3081424 eventually install correctly?<b><br /> Because the initial failed install has been found to create a bad entry in the Windows 10 registry which stops its subsequent attempts to reinstall from working correctly.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<b>What To Do?</b> \n\n\nThe good news is, despite Windows 10’s best efforts, some industrious users have found a temporary fix to get rid of this bad registry entry.

There’s the issue of \npicking a set of components that are all compatible with one another, \nalong with other factors that you need to weigh, including price, needs \nand more.</p>\n<p>When it comes to CPUs, you have one of two firms to choose from: AMD \nand Intel. These companies make virtually all of the world’s desktop PC \nCPUs, but that’s where the similarities between the two firms end, for \nthe most part. So, should you go for an AMD or Intel CPU when building \nyour PC?</p>\n<p>Here, I’ll&nbsp;shed some light on the differences between Intel’s \nand AMD’s CPU offerings, which will help you make an informed decision \nwhen it comes to picking out a processor.</p>\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n<p>Both companies offer processors at a wide range of price points, but \nAMD chips are available for less. The least expensive Sempron and Athlon\n dual-core processors sell for between $30 and $40. Intel’s least \nexpensive Celeron, the G1820 dual-core, is $45.&nbsp;That doesn’t \nnecessarily mean AMD chips are a better value, however. &nbsp;Reviewers \nhave generally found <a href='http://www.techspot.com/review/806-amd-kabini-vs-intel-bay-trail-d/page4.html'>that Intel provides superior compute performance per dollar</a>,\n even at the low end of the market. You’ll generally receive a better \nprocessor for your money buy purchasing a Celeron, Pentium or Core \nproduct.</p>\n<p>There two important exceptions to this. AMD sells quads for far less \nthan Intel — you can pick up an A6-5400K with four cores for just $45. \nIn theory, you&nbsp;<em>might</em> be better off with AMD if you use software that benefits from many cores, but can’t afford a $180 Core i5 quad.</p>\n<p>AMD chips also tend to offer better integrated graphics at any given price point. <a href='http://www.digitaltrends.com/processor-reviews/amd-a107870k-review/'>The AMD A10-7870K</a>, for example, can play most games at low to medium detail and 1080p resolution. It’s no <a href='http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/'>gaming</a>\n powerhouse, but it greatly exceeds the performance of any Intel HD \nGraphics solution, so you might be better off with AMD if you need to \nplay <em>League of Legends</em> on a budget.</p>\n<h3>Overclocking</h3>\n<p>Most CPUs&nbsp;have a fixed clock speed, and they’re typically set at\n a level which ensures that they’ll remain stable while performing \noptimally. Users looking to get more performance out of their CPU \nsometimes perform a tweak to the processor known as “overclocking,” \nwhich increases the CPU’s clock speed above the base rate.</p>\n<img  src='http://icdn1.digitaltrends.com/image/extremeoverclock-625x417.jpg'alt='extremeoverclock' height='480' width='640'></img>\n<p>AMD supports overclocking most consistently than Intel. AMD A-Series \nAPUs offer the feature for as little as $45, and thereare six AMD chips \nwith an unlocked multiplier under $100. Intel offers only one budget \noverclocking option, the Pentium G3258, at $70. It’s a doozy, though, as\n many samples overclock from the base clock of 3.2GHz up to around \n4.5GHz.</p>\n<p>Intel doesn’t really offer over-clocking in mid-range chips, while \nAMD does. Whether that makes AMD the better choice if you’re willing to \noverclock is arguable, and depends both on how much effort you’re \nwilling to put into over-clocking, and the workload your system will \nrun.</p>\n<p>There are several high-end Intel chips with overclocking, some \noffering eight physical cores. These chips are quicker than anything AMD\n can offer at stock clocks, so when overclocked they indisputably \ndominate. You can’t buy anything quicker for home use.</p>\n<h3>Game&nbsp;performance</h3>\n<p>Gaming is one area where picking a CPU can get tricky. AMD offers \nmany processors which are sold as APUs, which means they combine the \nprocessor with Radeon graphics on the same chip. These offer excellent \nvalue for low-end gaming. Intel also has on-die integrated graphics, but\n its performance isn’t up to par with AMD’s Radeon.</p>\n<img src='http://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/battlefield-4-naval-strike-1500x1000.jpg?ver=2' alt='Battlefield-4-naval-strike' height='480' width='640'></img>\n<p>But here’s the catch — AMD chips aren’t as quick as Intel’s, and that\n can drag high-end gaming down.&nbsp;Intel’s i5 and i7 CPUs can take \nsignificantly better advantage of a high-end graphics card if you’re \nworking with a higher budget. The difference between an&nbsp;AMD \nprocessor and a similarly priced Intel Core i3 or i5 <a href='http://www.anandtech.com/show/9307/the-kaveri-refresh-godavari-review-testing-amds-a10-7870k/7' target='_blank'>can be as high as 30 or 40 frames per second</a> if you have a very high-end graphics card.</p>\n<p>As such, I don’t recommend buying an AMD processor if high-end gaming is your goal.</p>\n<h3>Power efficiency</h3>\n<p>AMD’s struggle to keep up with Intel is actually worse than it first \nappears. The company has managed to stay somewhat competitive, but to do\n so its processors must consume far more power.</p>\n<p>Intel’s Pentiun G3258, for example, is rated with a&nbsp;Thermal \nDesign Power of 53 watts. AMD’s A6-7400K, which is priced similarly, has\n 65-watt TDP. Even so, reviews have found the Pentium chip quicker \nby&nbsp;most performance metrics, and sometimes by a substantial margin.</p>\n<p>With a desktop, this means the Intel chip will perform better while \nusing less power. This is unlikely to have be noticeable on your power \nbill, but the AMD desktop will produce more noise and heat.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking at a laptop, the efficiency gap is important \nbecause it will impact battery life. Intel-powered systems tend to last \nfar longer on a charge. This weakness has nearly pushed&nbsp;AMD out of \nthe laptop market altogether. The company’s APUs are rarely found in \nsystems sold above $500, and I wouldn’t recommend buying an expensive \nAMD-powered laptop if you find one.</p>\n<h3>The bottom line</h3>\n<p>AMD and Intel have battled for two decades, but in recent years the \nbattle has become a bit one-sided. New Pentium and Core chips have \nslowly edged out AMD at a variety of price points.</p>\n<p>If you have a high budget, then Intel is obviously the way to go. \nThis remains true until your budget falls low enough that the cheapest \nCore i5 quad is no longer an option for you. AMD just can’t compete with\n Intel’s best.</p>\n<p>Those on a budget should give AMD’s chips a look. They offer more \ncores and better integrated graphics for those who have less than $180 \nto spend on a processor. These traits can make up for AMD’s inferior \nper-core performance in certain workloads. For example, the <a rel='follow' target='' href='http://www.digitaltrends.com/processor-reviews/amd-a107870k-review/'>A10-7870K</a>\n tends to encode video&nbsp;faster than similarly priced Intel Core i3 \nchips. It also offers far superior graphics performance if a discrete \nvideo card is not a possibility.</p>\n<p>However, Intel has its perks. Even the company’s dual-cores are \nsurprisingly competitive with Intel quads in intense workloads. Intel \nchips are also far more power efficient, so they tend to produce less \nnoise and heat. Those traits can be important for a family PC, \nand&nbsp;if you’re looking at a laptop, Intel’s greater efficiency \nmeans&nbsp;better&nbsp;battery life.</p>\n<p><strong>So, the bottom line is this</strong>: Intel is generally \nsuperior. There are situations where AMD makes sense, but the company \nhas been reduced to depending on niche scenarios. If you can’t make up \nyour mind, go Intel. It’s likely the better choice for you.</p>\n</article>","comment":[{"commenter":"Robert","date":"2015-08-11T09:30:15.756Z","commentData":"East or West Intel is the Best !!!","rating":"7"},{"commenter":"Flynn","date":"2015-08-11T09:34:31.772Z","commentData":"Intel provides better performance at a higher cost....\nSo that is arguable.....\nNot all Intel processors can beat AMD outright...\n\nChoosing a processor ultimately depends on the user.","rating":"8"}]}]
